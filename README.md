#### What is JavaGame?
JavaGame is a game project that have been working on since May 2013. I have added many features to the game over the last year and I plan on adding even more features. This game is purely for my own sake to practice my skills in Java.

#### Why name it JavaGame?
Well i'm still not sure what exactly i'm going to do with it, and I haven't thought of a suitable name either. I hope to change the name in the near future

#### Your version naming is all wrong
Yes, I recently noticed that there is a standard called Semantic Versioning that I should follow. Currently my project isn't organised as well as I hoped so starting from the Beta I will follow Semantic Versioning schema.

#### Your project is lacking comments
I don't know why I have not commented my code but now I'm at a stage where I cannot go back to comment the entire project, I should of commented my code from the outset. This is going to be a reminder for me in the future.
